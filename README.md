# Price-Comparison-Tool-for-Food-Delivery-Apps
develop a mobile app that will allow users to compare prices across four major food delivery apps in Saudi Arabia. The app will not handle any transactions, it will simply display the cheapest option, and the user will then be directed to the original food delivery app to complete their order. Key Requirements: Data Scraping & Crawling: Develop a reliable method to scrape and crawl data from the four major food delivery apps in Saudi Arabia. Ensure the data gathered is accurate, up-to-date, and valid for comparison. Implement the solution in a mobile-friendly way to minimize load times and optimize data delivery. Data Structure: Design and maintain a clean, efficient, and scalable data structure that allows us to easily compare prices across various products. The structure should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in app interfaces or pricing formats. Mobile App Development: The app will only display the price comparisons and redirect users to the relevant food delivery apps. You should have experience with mobile development platforms (e.g., Flutter, React Native, or native iOS/Android) and ensure the app is optimized for both Android and iOS. Skills Needed: Experience with mobile app development (Flutter/React Native or Native iOS/Android). Familiarity with web scraping and crawling techniques, especially on mobile platforms. Strong knowledge of APIs, data integration, and structuring information for mobile apps.
--------
Creating a mobile app to compare prices across four major food delivery apps in Saudi Arabia is a great project! Since this involves data scraping and crawling, followed by comparison logic, along with mobile app development, here's a step-by-step approach, including sample React Native code for building the app and handling the tasks involved.
Overview:

    Data Scraping & Crawling:
        You'll need a server-side application that scrapes data from the four major food delivery platforms' websites or APIs.
        Scraping techniques could involve web scraping libraries (e.g., Puppeteer, Cheerio, or BeautifulSoup in Python).
        If APIs are available for these platforms, that’s a better choice for structured data extraction.

    Mobile App Development:
        The React Native app will show the price comparison of different food delivery platforms and allow the user to choose the cheapest one. Once selected, the user will be redirected to the respective app’s URL to complete the order.

    Backend:
        A backend (Node.js, Python Flask, etc.) will scrape the data and serve it to the React Native app via an API. This backend will handle requests like fetching the latest data, comparing prices, etc.

Step 1: Web Scraping & Backend

You'll likely need to create a web scraper on the server that will gather data from the four food delivery apps. The scraper will regularly pull data (like menu prices) and store it in a structured way (e.g., JSON format).

Example Web Scraping (Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy):

Here’s a simple example using Python and BeautifulSoup for scraping. This is just for illustration; you’ll need to tailor it to the specific website structure.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Function to scrape food prices
def scrape_prices_from_app(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    prices = []
    
    # Assume we're scraping the food prices from product elements
    products = soup.find_all('div', class_='product')
    for product in products:
        name = product.find('span', class_='name').text
        price = product.find('span', class_='price').text
        prices.append({'name': name, 'price': price})
    
    return prices

# Example URL from the food delivery app
url = 'https://examplefooddeliveryapp.com/menu'
prices = scrape_prices_from_app(url)
print(prices)

Backend API (Node.js/Express Example to Serve Data): Once the data is scraped, you’ll create an API that the React Native app will consume to display the prices.

const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Dummy function to simulate scraping (you'd integrate real scraping logic here)
const getFoodDeliveryPrices = async () => {
  // Normally you’d call your scraper here to get the data
  return [
    { app: 'App1', food: 'Pizza', price: 25 },
    { app: 'App2', food: 'Pizza', price: 22 },
    { app: 'App3', food: 'Pizza', price: 24 },
    { app: 'App4', food: 'Pizza', price: 26 }
  ];
};

app.get('/api/compare-prices', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const prices = await getFoodDeliveryPrices();
    const cheapest = prices.reduce((prev, current) => (prev.price < current.price ? prev : current));
    res.json({ prices, cheapest });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching price data' });
  }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

Step 2: React Native Mobile App
Install React Native

First, set up your React Native environment:

npx react-native init FoodPriceComparer
cd FoodPriceComparer

Display Data in React Native

Now, let’s fetch and display the scraped data in your React Native app.

App.js (Main File):

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [cheapest, setCheapest] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch price comparison data from backend
    axios.get('http://your-backend-url/api/compare-prices')
      .then(response => {
        setData(response.data.prices);
        setCheapest(response.data.cheapest);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      });
  }, []);

  const redirectToApp = (appName) => {
    // Redirect to the respective food delivery app (you may use deep linking)
    switch (appName) {
      case 'App1':
        // Replace with the actual app URL or deep link
        console.log('Redirecting to App1...');
        break;
      case 'App2':
        console.log('Redirecting to App2...');
        break;
      case 'App3':
        console.log('Redirecting to App3...');
        break;
      case 'App4':
        console.log('Redirecting to App4...');
        break;
      default:
        console.log('No valid app selected');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Food Price Comparison</Text>
      {cheapest && (
        <View style={styles.cheapestContainer}>
          <Text style={styles.cheapestText}>Cheapest Option:</Text>
          <Text>{cheapest.app} - {cheapest.food}: {cheapest.price}</Text>
          <Button
            title={`Order from ${cheapest.app}`}
            onPress={() => redirectToApp(cheapest.app)}
          />
        </View>
      )}

      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => `${item.app}-${item.food}`}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.itemContainer}>
            <Text>{item.app} - {item.food}: {item.price}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  cheapestContainer: {
    marginBottom: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  cheapestText: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  itemContainer: {
    marginBottom: 10,
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f9f9f9',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;

Key Features in React Native Code:

    Fetching Data: The app fetches the price comparison data from the backend API.
    Displaying Results: It displays a list of prices for different apps and highlights the cheapest option.
    Redirecting to App: When the user taps on the cheapest option, the app redirects to the respective food delivery app (you may need to implement deep linking or URL redirection).

Step 3: Data Structure

For efficient data comparison, ensure that your backend API structures the data consistently:

{
  "prices": [
    {
      "app": "App1",
      "food": "Pizza",
      "price": 25
    },
    {
      "app": "App2",
      "food": "Pizza",
      "price": 22
    }
  ],
  "cheapest": {
    "app": "App2",
    "food": "Pizza",
    "price": 22
  }
}

This format is flexible and allows easy modification if the format of the scraped data changes over time.
Step 4: Testing and Optimization

    Testing: Thoroughly test the app to ensure it properly compares prices and redirects users as expected.
    Optimization: Use techniques like caching scraped data, and paginating large data sets to keep the app fast and responsive.

Conclusion

By combining web scraping, backend logic, and a React Native mobile app, you can build an efficient food price comparison tool for users in Saudi Arabia. Ensure data accuracy by regularly scraping the platforms and optimizing both the backend and mobile app for a seamless user experience.
